HypercubeRouting
================

Simple algorithm for routing on a hypercube topology.

The program displays the sequence of nodes that a packet travels from a source node to a destination node in a hypercube network topology.



The program needs three parameters:

- Hypercube's dimension (integer greater than 1).
- Source node (integer between 0 and (2^dim)-1).
- Destination node (integer between 0 y (2^dim)-1).
